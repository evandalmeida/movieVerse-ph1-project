# movieVerse Project
Welcome to the movieVerse project! This is a simple web application that allows you to create a watchlist and view movie information with their corresponding posters. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.



## Introduction
movieVerse is a basic web application that aims to provide a personalized movie watchlist. You can add movies to your watchlist and view their details along with their posters.

The application consists of three main sections:
1. `watchlist-container`: This section displays the watchlist where you can add movies.
2. `movie-posters`: Here, you will find the movie posters. Each poster is enclosed within a div element.
3. `movie-card`: This section provides detailed information about the selected movie.



## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:
- `index.html`: This file contains the HTML structure of the movieVerse application.
- `index.css`: The stylesheet file that defines the application's visual appearance.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the interactivity of the application.



## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Inside your terminal run the command "json-server --watch db.json"
3. In the "watchList" section, you can add movies by entering their titles. Click the "Add to Watchlist" button to add a movie.
4. The movie posters will be displayed in the `movie-posters` section. Click on a movie poster to view detailed information about the movie in the `movie-card` section.
5. In the `movie-card` section, you will find the movie's title, release date, description, and runtime.
6. The "Watched?" button allows you to mark a movie as watched, while the "Like" button lets you express your liking for a movie.
7. Movies that are added to your watchlist will be displayed in the `watchlist-container` section. To remove a movie from your watchlist, double-click on the movie's title in the watchlist.
